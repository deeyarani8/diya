Their proactive security measures help prevent attacks and keep your website safe.

### Scalability
During a crisis, news websites often experience massive surges in traffic. Scala Hosting's VPS solutions are highly scalable, allowing you to easily increase your resources as needed. This ensures your website can handle the increased load without slowing down or crashing. You can upgrade your CPU, RAM, and storage with minimal downtime.

### Pricing
Scala Hosting offers various VPS plans tailored to different needs. Their entry-level managed VPS plans start at an affordable price point and scale up to more powerful configurations for high-traffic websites.
